## Data Types

| Type | Size (bytes) | Tested | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| `char` | 1 | Yes | Stored as numeric. Sign-extended on cast. `unsigned char` parsed but treated as signed. |
| `short` | 2 | Yes | Sign-extended on cast. `unsigned short` parsed but treated as signed. |
| `int` | 4 | Yes | 32-bit signed via `toInt32()`. `Math.imul` for multiplication. `unsigned int` parsed but treated as signed. |
| `long` | 8 | Partial | Parsed and sized correctly, but arithmetic uses 32-bit (`toInt32`), not 64-bit. |
| `float` | 4 | Yes | Stored as JS `number` (64-bit double internally). No single-precision truncation. Display uses `toFixed(6)` with trailing zero stripping. |
| `double` | 8 | Yes | Full JS `number` precision. |
| `void` | 0 | Yes | Used as pointer target type for `malloc` return. |
| Pointers (`int*`, `char*`, etc.) | 4 | Yes | 32-bit addresses. Hex display. Pointer arithmetic scales by `sizeof(*p)`. |
| Arrays (`int[N]`) | N × element | Yes | Stack-allocated. Indexed children. Bounds checking on read and write. |
| Multi-dimensional arrays (`int[M][N]`) | M × N × element | Yes | Flattened `[i][j]` children. Nested init_list parsing. |
| Structs | Computed with alignment | Yes | Fields with offsets/padding. Nested structs. Init lists. |
| String literals (`char *s = "hello"`) | Heap-allocated | Yes | Char array with null terminator. Individual char children. |
| Function pointers (`int (*fp)(int,int)`) | 4 (pointer-sized) | Yes | Declare, assign, reassign, call through pointer. Display shows `-> funcName`. |

**Integer model:** ILP32. All integer arithmetic is signed 32-bit (`n | 0`). Unsigned integer semantics are not implemented — `unsigned` qualifiers are parsed but normalized away.

**Alignment rules:** Each primitive aligns to its own size. Structs align to their largest field's alignment. Struct tail padding applied to reach alignment boundary. Arrays align to element type.

## Operators

### Arithmetic
| Operator | Behavior | Tested | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|

| `sizeof(type)` | Returns size from type system | Yes |
| `sizeof(expr)` | Returns size of expression's type. Arrays return full size (not decayed pointer). | Yes |
| Cast `(type)expr` | Truncation: char→8-bit, short→16-bit, int→`\|0`. Float-to-int: `Math.trunc`. Int-to-float: preserves value. | Yes |
| Address-of `&` | Returns stack or heap address | Yes |
| Dereference `*` | Reads via memReader. Null pointer check. | Yes |

---

## Control Flow

| Construct | Sub-step generation | Tested | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| `if` / `else` / `else if` | Condition shown as step with `→ true/false` result | Yes | Not a sub-step — condition is the main event on the if-line |

| `while` | Condition check (sub-step) per iteration | Yes | |
| `do-while` | Body first, then condition check (sub-step) | Yes | |

## Partially Working

| Feature | What works | What doesn't | Notes |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| `long` (64-bit) | Parsed and sized (8 bytes) | Arithmetic treated as 32-bit in evaluator | Would need BigInt or separate evaluation path |
| Preprocessor | `#include` ignored gracefully | `#define`, `#ifdef`, etc. ignored with warning | By design — not a real preprocessor |
| 3D+ arrays | Type system supports nesting | Only 2D write/init tested; 3D untested | Medium difficulty to fix |
| `sprintf` format specifiers | `%d`, `%i`, `%x`, `%c`, `%s`, `%%` with byte-by-byte writes | `%f`, `%p`, `%u` not yet supported in sprintf's internal formatter (they work in printf). | `evaluateSprintfResult` uses a simpler parser than `applyPrintfFormat` |
| `scanf` format specifiers | `%d`, `%i`, `%c`, `%f`, `%x`, `%*` (suppression) | `%i` octal/hex prefix not implemented (treated as `%d`). `%s` consumes but doesn't write to char array byte-by-byte. | |
| printf/scanf length modifiers | Length modifiers parsed and ignored | `%ld`, `%lf`, `%zu` not distinguished from `%d`, `%f` | `%lf` is common in student code with `double` |
| Empty loop bodies | Doesn't crash, loop variable advances | May produce interpreter errors internally | |

| Single source file | No multi-file compilation or linking |
| No recursive struct pointer types | `struct Node { struct Node *next; }` — pointer fields work but self-referential layout depends on registry order |
